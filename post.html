                        <p>I met some of the most important people in my life in Hong Kong. They have been incredibly supportive. </p>
                        <p>Moreover, The drama club occupied a huge portion of my Hong Kong secondary school life. I did not know I loved performing and acting so much before joining the club. My teammates were so goofy and funny. I have always enjoyed their accompany. Even though we had to sacrifice our lunch break for practice time, it was absolutely worth it. </p>
                        <p>The first year was on-stage performance. Unfortunately, in the second year, we had to do it through Zoom due to COVID-19. Such a bummer. There were a lot of new members and we could not meet and interact with each other in person. Nevertheless, I was grateful all the teammates were very passionate about acting. Really proud hahaa:p we won a few prizes. If I have a chance, I would love to perform with them again. This time will be on stage.</p>
                        <p>Other than drama club, ice skating was indispensable. Every Friday, I had to go to the rink and practice. I remember whenever I could not go there, I would wrap myself in the blanket and cry. The ice skating rink was my other home. I felt relaxed when I was skating. Plus, my friends from the rink were like sisters. Another reason I loved ice skating so much is because I would have the opportunity to travel to other countries to participate in competitions. Fun fact after I stopped skating, I gained 5kg. </p>
                        <p>Two years later, I visited Hong Kong. I made a video of surprising my best friend. It was so funny she cried a lot then I could not hold it and cried with her. Flying back to Hong Kong, I had reunions with lots of my friends. Two weeks was too short. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Transfer to Taiwan</h2>
                        <p>In 2021, I transferred to Kang Chiao. I didn’t know anyone when I arrived as a newbie. However, it wasn't long before I encountered my first friend, Miki, in English class. Her name left a strong impression on me since "Miki" reminded me of Mickey Mouse. Since we were both new transfers, we encountered similar obstacles. We struggled through schoolwork and engaged with our classmates.</p>
                        <p>I was grateful to have someone who was in the same boat as me. Even though we haven't known each other for very long, she has been an incredibly supportive friend. When my brother passed away, she was always there for me. We Facetime each other every day. The first thing I did whenever I arrived home was to open my laptop and go to the website we called. I enjoyed her company. It was pleasant and relaxing, helping me to forget the bitterness of the day.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

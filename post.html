                        <p>I met some of the most important people in my life in Hong Kong. They have been incredibly supportive. </p>
                        <p>Moreover, The drama club occupied a huge portion of my Hong Kong secondary school life. I did not know I loved performing and acting so much before joining the club. My teammates were so goofy and funny. I have always enjoyed their accompany. Even though we had to sacrifice our lunch break for practice time, it was absolutely worth it. </p>
                        <p>The first year was on-stage performance. Unfortunately, in the second year, we had to do it through Zoom due to COVID-19. Such a bummer. There were a lot of new members and we could not meet and interact with each other in person. Nevertheless, I was grateful all the teammates were very passionate about acting. Really proud hahaa:p we won a few prizes. If I have a chance, I would love to perform with them again. This time will be on stage.</p>
                        <p>Other than drama club, ice skating was indispensable. Every Friday, I had to go to the rink and practice. I remember whenever I could not go there, I would wrap myself in the blanket and cry. The ice skating rink was my other home. I felt relaxed when I was skating. Plus, my friends from the rink were like sisters. Another reason I loved ice skating so much is because I would have the opportunity to travel to other countries to participate in competitions. Fun fact after I stopped skating, I gained 5kg. </p>
                        <p>Two years later, I visited Hong Kong. I made a video of surprising my best friend. It was so funny she cried a lot then I could not hold it and cried with her. Flying back to Hong Kong, I had reunions with lots of my friends. Two weeks was too short. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Transfer to Taiwan</h2>
                        <p>In 2021, I transferred to Kang Chiao. I didn’t know anyone when I arrived as a newbie. However, it wasn't long before I encountered my first friend, Miki, in English class. Her name left a strong impression on me since "Miki" reminded me of Mickey Mouse. Since we were both new transfers, we encountered similar obstacles. We struggled through schoolwork and engaged with our classmates.</p>
                        <p>I was grateful to have someone who was in the same boat as me. Even though we haven't known each other for very long, she has been an incredibly supportive friend. When my brother passed away, she was always there for me. We Facetime each other every day. The first thing I did whenever I arrived home was to open my laptop and go to the website we called. I enjoyed her company. It was pleasant and relaxing, helping me to forget the bitterness of the day.</p>

                        <p>I had been desperate to join the school volleyball club since tenth grade, but my mum did not allow it. I was overjoyed when my mum permitted me to join in my last year of high school. The friendships formed on the volleyball team were priceless. At first, my teammates and I were a bit awkward as we did not know each other. But slowly, as we began training, we started chatting a bit and introduced ourselves. Each teammate had a unique and different personality, but we blended so well. As we became closer, I felt excited when the eighth period of class ended, signaling the start of the after-school sports club.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Make Youtube videos</h2>
                        <p>In my first year of high school, I created my own YouTube channel, beginning to share my life with others. Right now, whenever I feel down or nostalgic, I can play those videos or look at the pictures to revisit precious memories. It is like opening a time capsule. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/youtube 2024-05-16 at 10.40.30.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is my first ever Youtube video;)</span>
                        <p>I am fond of editing and filming. My first video was about ice skating. The day when I first started to film the video, I filmed the skating process like I was taking a selfie. I held my phone, clicked the record button, and started speaking. On the second day of filming, I became increasingly involved as I recorded the videos at the rink. I experimented with various shooting angles. Even though I was sweating heavily, I continued experimenting with filming angles. </p>
                        <p>I have learned to cherish all the moments of life. I’ve found telling my stories and sharing my perspectives with others fascinating. Life is like a film. When I film in first-person perspective, the viewer can see from my perspective. It is almost like they are living like me, experiencing my life. After filming, I can always re-experience those moments and remember the feelings.</p>
